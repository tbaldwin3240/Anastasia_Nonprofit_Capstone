        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p> Greetings, my name is Anastasia Caphart, and I am in the Education Specialist Degree program in 
            Instructional Technology at Kennesaw State University where I began the program in the Fall of 2015 
            (with two-semester break) and will graduate Fall 2017.  I graduated from Kennesaw State University
             in 2004 with a Master's degree in Early Childhood Education, preceded by my Bachelor of Science
              Degree in Elementary Education, with emphasis on Language Arts and Social Studies, from the 
              University of Liberia in 1985. Hence, my career commenced as a full-time teacher in parochial,
               private and public schools.Currently, I volunteer with Teacher Consultant Group. Inc. where I work with early childhood educators and children of diverse background. My objective was to gain acceptance into the Instructional Technology Specialist Program at KSU because it provided opportunities for engagement in best practices for becoming a 21st Century educator/learner in the United States and supports my interest in working overseas with countries facing education emergencies during crisis. Based on KSU's reputation in instructional technology led me to the Specialist's Degree program in the Department of Instructional Technology. I plan to continue with my education by pursuing my doctoral degree in Early Childhood Education at KSU.

The purpose of this portfolio is for me to demonstrate mastery of the PSC Instructional Technology Standards and the ISTE NETS-C standards. As you can see, there are a series of links in the menu above. Of importance is the "standards" link. Under this link, you will see a series of artifacts and reflections documenting the important work I have completed during this program. Each artifact represents mastery of the standard under which it is represented.
        
​I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Kennesaw State University, and feel that I am well-prepared to integrate technology into my classroom and to assist other educators in using technology and providing professional learning opportunities for them.
